# insertion-sort
patika - insertion sort exercise


- ite sorting phase of the given array : [22,27,16,2,18,6]  : 
      
      1.	[(2),27,16,22,18,6]
      2.	[(2,6),16,22,18,27]
      3.	[(2,6,16),18,22,27]
      4.     [(2,6,16,18),22,27]
      5.	[(2,6,16,18,22),27]
      6.	[(2,6,16,18,22,27)]

- write time according to big-O notation: 
      
      O(n²) = O(6²) = O(36)

- time complexity case of findign 18 in current array:
      
      Average case because 18 is in the middle of the array
      
- write first first 4 sorting phase of this array [7,3,5,8,2,9,4,15,6] :
     
      1. [(2),3,5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
      2. [(2,3),5,8,7,9,4,15,6]
      3. [(2,3,4),8,7,9,5,15,6]
      4. [(2,3,4,5),7,9,8,15,6]
